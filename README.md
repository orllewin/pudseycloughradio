# Pudsey Clough Radio 

This repository contains the website for the web frontend of Pudsey Clough Radio: [pudseyclough.uk](https://pudseyclough.uk). The website operates using [sqlite3 WASM](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/index.md) - a database is loaded at startup and queried every time a new file is played on the server, updating the page.
